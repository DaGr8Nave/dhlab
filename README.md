# AmericanModernism (N. Bergam, J. Li)
We currently have two missions in regards to applying digital humanities 

## Mission 1: The "Infinity Stones" of Salinger's Short Stories

We believe there are some convincing thematic and character similarities between the 'Nine Stories' and the various 'episodes' of Holden's journey in 'The Catcher in the Rye.' These are specific comparisons we have in mind, from our own reading. 
     1) Mr. Antonelli and Seymour Glass: Why is Salinger pressuring the reader to assume these men are pedophiles?
     2) Holden Caulfield and Teddy: How do they relate time with
     
We hope that, through digital humanities techniques like Topic Modeling, we can illuminate these connections qualitatively and furthermore establish new connections.
     

## Mission 2: Nietszchean Philosophy in Faulkner

## Mission 3: Themes in Children's Storytelling

## Future
Up to this point, we have treated texts as a “bag of words”; we’ve split up novels into arrays of singular words and focused on the frequency and similarity of individual words rather than how these words might interact with each other. Although it has allowed us to write a variety useful functions, our current method of analysis is constrained by it’s superficiality.  By creating algorithms which examine larger word combinations and phrases, we may be able to gain  more “human” understandings of texts and ultimately draw more accurate meaningful observations. We plan to use the research of people who have taken on this endevour to inspire our own.
