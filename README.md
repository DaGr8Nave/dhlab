# AmericanModernism (N. Bergam, J. Li, J. Lee)
We are the digital humanities pioneers for the Pingry School's Humanities Independent Research program. We are working to create algorithms for our own research projects as well as for public use. 

## Purpose

The beauty of natural language processing and digital humanities is often hidden from the general population of writers and readers, and we believe that is a problem. While, of course, a computer can never read and analyze text to the extent that a human can, it has the capacity to make interesting connections and see large scale patterns through objective, numerical analyses. As such, the capability of computers in regards to text analysis should be available to everyone. We designed these algorithms on an interactive web format in order to bridge the gap, to allow all readers and writers to witness for themselves the potential of language processing.

## Libraries Used
Matplotlib
Numpy
Scipy
NLTK (natural language toolkit)
Flask 


## Future

Up to this point, we have treated texts as a “bag of words”; we’ve split up novels into arrays of singular words and focused on the frequency and similarity of individual words rather than how these words might interact with each other. Although it has allowed us to write a variety useful functions, our current method of analysis is constrained by its superficiality.  By creating algorithms which examine larger word combinations and the interplay between words and phrases,  we may be able to gain  more “human” understandings of texts and ultimately draw more accurate meaningful observations.
