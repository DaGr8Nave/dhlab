I met with TJ in my office for more than an hour.  TJ presents himself as a highly energetic, poised and confident young man.   After getting to know him and hearing his thoughts and accomplishments, he exceeded my first impression and is one of the top candidates I have seen in my 8 years of interviewing.  His maturity and vision for his future stands out against high school graduates.  

TJ comes from a high achieving family of medicine and business.  Ivy educated older siblings and parents with multiple degrees have set a very high bar for a youngest of 3 child, but TJ seems unphased by it, choosing his own path and achieving at the highest level.  

TJ shows his youth by talking quickly, though with a charming smile.  I found that he mentioned many activities and organizations one after the other – it was challenging to keep up.  What I didn’t understand was that his fast talking belied a very high intellect with a genuine enthusiasm to talk about the many many things that he has done.  I came to fully understand this when he handed me his resume – 3 full pages of education, volunteer work, awards, clubs, summer experiences, research papers and work experience.  There wasn’t enough time in my interview to discuss all TJ had done – but after the time we spent together I was left with the strong sense that he organizes his time thoughtfully, works very hard, enjoys his life and is proud of his accomplishments.  

TJ started our conversation talking about his volunteer work, specifically about his founding the Delbarton chapter of Bring Change to Mind, a mental health awareness platform.  He identified with empathy the pressure and challenges of young people’s lives.  He said suicide prevention was a primary focus having known more than one who had made that choice.  He wanted to make sure that didn’t happen at his school.  He then talked about his leading Delbarton’s connection to a local youth organization, Neighborhood House, where he brings classmates to help underserved children with homework and supervision.  He also volunteered for the current NJ Governor’s campaign; he leads Delbarton’s efforts to support the local Interfaith Food Pantry; he coaches mentally challenged children at EPOCH; and volunteers at Bridges distributing food to shelters.  More, at school he supports fellow students in math, Spanish and writing, as well as runs, as Program Leader, the Delbarton Student Ambassadors, where he said he was going to welcome a group of more than 200 people this coming Saturday.  

As I dug a little deeper, TJ made it clear to me that his passion in life is connecting with others and making a difference in their lives.  He wants to work in the not-for-profit world or potentially in government effecting policy and change.  I believe that he was profoundly affected by his summer experience at Yale’s Young Global Scholars program.  His vocabulary is more like that of a seasoned international professional than of a high school senior – advocacy, global issues, women’s access to the economy, effecting change.  He was almost giddy with his desire to go out and make a difference.  

That said, TJ is still a teenager – he loves sports in all capacities.  However, after sophomore year he de-emphasized playing for school teams, instead choosing to participate in intramural teams allowing him to do the other activities described above.  But he maintained his love of sports organizing a quarterly Sports Debate event, writing about sports in the Sports Journalism Club, and coaching and helping disabled children in volunteer organizations.  He said that he often does some kind of physical activities to give himself a break when studying – playing some basketball or going for a run.  

I asked TJ to talk about his biggest challenge/disappointment.  He mentioned the passing of his grandfather describing his relationship in very kind and sympathetic ways since he died of Parkinsons.  But he said, by far, his biggest disappointment was losing the school presidency election (he was elected Student Council Treasurer).  He has been a class leader throughout – and had been class president before, but in this election he lost.  He talked about his surprise and the thought process that took him to recover.  He talked to many, including his father, about leadership and discovered that title doesn’t make you a leader – actions and principals do.  He talked with great pride about how he has positively affected the school even though he was not elected its president.  He showed strong character – he was able to accept the loss and move forward.  He has made his role as a class leader become as important as the president’s.  He used good examples citing how he positively affected the Delbarton Diversity Among Peers organization by bringing his classmates even though he is not its president, and how he is very visible around school generating enthusiasm for whatever is going on.  

TJ had a terrific answer about, Why Yale?  He spent 2 weeks this past summer at Yale participating in Yale Young Global Scholars.  He loved the campus, loved the emphasis on academic learning and loved meeting peers from all over the globe.  His experience pulled together his passion for effecting change by seeing the infinite challenges around the globe.  I know that last summer is one of the reasons he feels there is a terrific fit for him at Yale.  

TJ is one of the best candidates I have seen in my 8 years of interviewing.  I never ask about a students early application process, but TJ volunteered that he didn’t apply early anywhere because he wanted to have a choice.  That decision created tension at home but he withstood the pressure and did his applications his way.  TJ will be one of the amazing classmates that you meet, full of positive energy, willing and able to help, initiating activities that engage his classmates.  And Yale would be a great place for him to further his genuine passion for helping others; Yale would broaden TJ’s exposure to what’s possible and help him decide how to effect change on a grand scale.  TJ is going to go to a great school, I strongly recommend that it be Yale.  I cannot recommend him highly enough.
