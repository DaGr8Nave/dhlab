    <h4> Readability Metrics </h4>
    <p> The following information reports on the different
    parts of your essay in terms of readability. Make no mistake, the
    idea of readability and the complexity of writing is highly subjective; nevertheless, there have been indices established in
    order to give an objective idea of how 'sophisticated' a certain piece of
    writing might be, based on the lengths of words and sentences. Here are a few of them. </p>

    <h6> Flesch Reading Ease </h6>
    <p> 206.83 - 1.015(avg_sentence_length) - 84.6(avg_syllable_count) </p>

    <h6> Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level </h6>
    <p> 0.39(avg_sentence_length) + 11.8(avg_syllable_count) - 15.59  </p>

    <h6> Gunning-Fog Index </h6>
    <p> 0.4(avg_sentence_length + percent_hard_words)
    <br> Hard words are defined as words that are greater than three syllables and are
  neither proper nouns, the combination of simpler words, nor 2 syllable words that are extended syllabically
by -es or -ed.</p>
