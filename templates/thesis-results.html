    <h4> Your work, colored by parts of speech: </h4> <br>


    <p> <b> How this can help you: </b> Splitting your writing by parts of speech in this sort of hyper-visual manner
    can allow you to quickly notice patterns in your writing. What are the tones of your adjectives?
    What nouns stand out from the rest? Do your pronouns have clear antecedents? How heavy is your writing on descriptors?
    As always with these sorts of tools, there isn't some obvious correct answer––we are merely providing you
    with an objective lens, a new perspective, to see your writing.</p>

    <h4> Readability Metrics </h4>
    <p> The following information reports on the different
    parts of your essay in terms of readability. Make no mistake, the
    idea of readability and the complexity of writing is highly subjective; nevertheless, there have been indices established in
    order to give an objective idea of how 'sophisticated' a certain piece of
    writing might be, based on the lengths of words and sentences. Here are a few of them. </p>

    <h6> Flesch Reading Ease </h6>
    <p> 206.83 - 1.015(avg_sentence_length) - 84.6(avg_syllable_count) </p>

    <h6> Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level </h6>
    <p> 0.39(avg_sentence_length) + 11.8(avg_syllable_count) - 15.59  </p>

    <h6> Gunning-Fog Index </h6>
    <p> 0.4(avg_sentence_length + percent_hard_words)
    <br> Hard words are defined as words that are greater than three syllables and are
  neither proper nouns, the combination of simpler words, nor 2 syllable words that are extended syllabically
by -es or -ed.</p>
