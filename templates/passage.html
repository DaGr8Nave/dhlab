  <h1> Passage Sampling </h1>
  <p> This method is meant to allow you to sample passages of your text by certain keywords and themes.
   This is also good for randomly sampling a character and the contexts in which their name shows up.
 Play around and brainstorm!<p>


   <div class = "div2">
     {% include '/includes/_upload.html' %}
   </div>


  <form action = '/passage-results' method=post enctype=multipart/form-data>
